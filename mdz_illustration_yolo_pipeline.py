mdz_illustration_yolo_pipeline.py

Large-scale Bavarian State Library (Munich Digitization Center / MDZ)
book-page harvesting with GPU YOLO triage, searching for pages with RICH
ILLUSTRATION. Sibling script to bodleian_illustration_yolo_pipeline.py and
gallica_illustration_yolo_pipeline.py - same one-page-at-a-time GPU triage,
Azure upload strategy, and page_layout_best_new.pt model, pointed at MDZ's
search + IIIF APIs instead.

IMPORTANT - keeping this separate from the other pipelines' data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MDZ item ids look like "bsb10285575" - a distinct namespace from Bodleian's
UUID-style object ids and Gallica's "bpt6k..." ARK ids, so there's no risk
of a literal blob-name collision. Even so, this script follows the exact
same "<task>/<library>" file management plan laid out in
bodleian_illustration_yolo_pipeline.py, so every library's illustration
search lives in its own clearly labelled corner and nothing has to be
cross-checked by hand later:
  - --azure-prefix defaults to "illustrations/mdz" (siblings:
    "illustrations/bodleian_new", "illustrations/gallica",
    "illustrations/wellcome", "illustrations/ndl"),
  - --negative-audit-prefix defaults to "illustrations/mdz/negative_audit",
  - --output-dir defaults to "mdz_illustration_yolo_run" (siblings:
    "bodleian_illustration_yolo_run", "gallica_illustration_yolo_run",
    "wellcome_illustration_yolo_run", "ndl_illustration_yolo_run"), so
    local state/temp files never collide either,
  - --state-azure-prefix defaults to
    "state_backups/illustration_runs/mdz_illustration_yolo_run", alongside
    the other pipelines' own prefixes under the same "illustration_runs/"
    umbrella.
Because the output directories, Azure prefixes, and local temp/tmux
concerns are all fully separate, this script is safe to run at the same
time as the other four illustration pipelines in their own tmux sessions on
the same RunPod pod - see "Running all five illustration pipelines at once"
below.

API reference
-------------
https://www.digitale-sammlungen.de/en/p/2f1efadd-f415-4ab4-bff1-4b8e1fe1a551
    (MDZ's documented interfaces: IIIF Presentation/Image APIs, OCR
    endpoint, OAI-PMH via the Bavarian Digital Repository, RSS feed of
    recent additions. No REST/JSON search API is documented on this page.)

Search endpoint (UNDOCUMENTED - reverse-engineered, see caveat below):
    GET https://www.digitale-sammlungen.de/api/search
        ?query=<text>&handler=simple-all&startPage=<0-based>
        &pageSize=<n, capped server-side at 250>
        &filter=<field>:<value>   (repeatable)
This is the same JSON endpoint MDZ's own web search UI (digitale-
sammlungen.de/en/search) calls client-side; it is NOT listed on MDZ's
documented interfaces page linked above, so unlike the Bodleian/Gallica
search APIs its shape/availability is not a stable public contract. It was
confirmed live during development (see docstring "Be a good API citizen"
below for the resulting politeness posture). Each result document carries
an "id" (e.g. "bsb10285575"), an "iiifAvailable" boolean, and enough
bibliographic fields to skip a request entirely for items with no IIIF
manifest (see extract_item_id/manifest_url_from_result below). Filtering by
--type-media-filter uses the "type_media_facet" facet field (confirmed live
values: book, serial, issue, newspaper, map, part); confirmed live that
passing MULTIPLE values for this field does not straightforwardly OR them
(the last value observed to take effect in testing), so this pipeline
passes at most one value by default ("book") - pass a single override value
if you need something else, and verify empirically if you need more than
one.

IIIF manifest URL is deterministic from the item id:
    https://api.digitale-sammlungen.de/iiif/presentation/v2/{item_id}/manifest
Confirmed live: MDZ manifests are IIIF Presentation API 2.x (top-level
"sequences"/"canvases"), structurally identical to Digital Bodleian's and
Gallica's, so parse_iiif_manifest() below is the same version-agnostic walk
ported from those two pipelines - it additionally captures each canvas's
own "width"/"height" (present directly on MDZ canvases) as
canvas_width/canvas_height, which both sibling pipelines have also been
updated to record (see page_log.jsonl provenance fields below). A
manifest's "metadata" list uses IIIF's multilingual value shape
({"label": [{"@language": "en", "@value": "Title"}, ...], "value": ...})
rather than Bodleian/Gallica's plain-string labels, so
extract_book_metadata() below picks the English ("en") label text before
falling back to the first available language - see METADATA_LABELS and
metadata_label_text().

Default IIIF image width and MDZ's rate limit
-----------------------------------------------
MDZ's documented Image API limit is a cap on "the number of requests that
can be made to the Image API per 24 hours" (exact number undisclosed), not
a per-minute throttle like Gallica's. --iiif-width therefore defaults to
1200 (matching the Bodleian pipeline) rather than needing Gallica's
extra-conservative 1000/--image-sleep split. If a run does exhaust the
daily quota, MDZ is expected to respond with a 4xx status that isn't 429;
is_permanent_http_error() already treats any non-429 4xx as non-retryable
within the current run, so a quota-exhausted page stops cleanly (paused for
retry on a later run/day) instead of burning through --retries pointlessly.

Workflow
--------
1. Search MDZ for each keyword in KEYWORDS via the search endpoint above
   (default keywords are German - MDZ's catalogue and OCR text are
   overwhelmingly German-language, same rationale as the Gallica
   pipeline's French keyword list; see the English concept -> German
   keyword table below).
2. For each matching item with iiifAvailable=true, fetch its IIIF manifest
   (URL built deterministically from the item id) and enumerate every
   page/canvas.
3. Skip the whole item if it has fewer than --min-pages-per-book pages
   (default 5) - recorded as "skipped_too_short", never rechecked.
4. Otherwise walk every page. If the book has MORE than
   --edge-skip-threshold pages (default 20), the first/last
   --edge-skip-count pages (default 5 each) are logged (IIIF URL + position,
   action "skipped_edge_page") but never downloaded or run through YOLO.
   Every other page is processed ONE PAGE AT A TIME: download -> YOLO on
   GPU immediately (every detection, class+confidence+bbox - both pixel and
   image-normalized, plus its share of the page area - is recorded) ->
   illustration-positive pages are uploaded to Azure and the local copy
   deleted; illustration-negative pages are deleted, UNLESS a SHA-256
   deterministic sampling decision selects them for the negative QC audit
   sample (--negative-sample-rate), in which case they're uploaded to
   --negative-audit-prefix instead. Never more than one page image on local
   disk at a time.
5. Progress is checkpointed after every page to processed_items.json,
   resuming a killed run mid-book. A page-level error pauses the book
   (does NOT advance next_page_index) for retry on the next run, up to
   --max-page-retries attempts, before the book is marked
   "failed_permanent".
6. Every page decision (kept/deleted/skipped/error) is appended to
   page_log.jsonl with full provenance: generic source/source_item_id
   fields alongside the library-specific field kept for backward
   compatibility, the manifest URL, canvas id/label, page index/number, the
   IIIF image service URL, the exact requested image URL, the downloaded
   image's actual pixel dimensions (read from YOLO's own decode - never
   assumed to equal the requested IIIF width), the source canvas's
   width/height from the manifest when available, the blob name when
   uploaded, and - for illustration-negative pages - whether the page was
   selected for the negative audit sample and the deterministic sampling
   value used.
7. Book-level bibliographic metadata, the manifest's attribution/license,
   page counts, illustration-detection totals, and an illustration_density
   ratio are written to books.jsonl, one line per book.
8. processed_items.json/books.jsonl/page_log.jsonl/run_metadata.json are
   ALSO pushed to Azure under --state-azure-prefix every
   --state-upload-interval seconds (and once more at the end of the run),
   each upload overwriting the previous one - a RunPod pod can die without
   warning.
9. run_metadata.json is written once, the first time --output-dir is used,
   and never regenerated on a resumed run (even with different CLI flags) -
   it records which YOLO model (path + SHA-256 of the weights file), class
   names, imgsz, confidence threshold, illustration keywords, and
   Python/PyTorch/Ultralytics/CUDA versions actually produced the corpus in
   that directory. See load_or_create_run_metadata().

English concept -> default German keyword
------------------------------------------
    geometry     -> Geometrie          instruments -> Instrumente
    costume      -> Tracht             ornament    -> Ornament
    heraldry     -> Heraldik           medicine    -> Medizin
    illuminated  -> Buchmalerei        atlas       -> Atlas
    astronomy    -> Astronomie         cosmography -> Kosmographie
    bestiary     -> Bestiarium         book of hours -> Stundenbuch
    apocalypse   -> Apokalypse
Override with --keywords for a different list (e.g. to search MDZ's
non-German holdings, or add more German terms).

Default YOLO model
-------------------
Defaults to ./page_layout_best_new.pt (the same fine-tuned model as the
other two illustration pipelines' default), classes:
    illustration, text_block
A page is treated as "contains a rich illustration" when any detected class
name contains "illustration" (see --illustration-class-keywords).

Be a good API citizen
----------------------
No API key is required for any of MDZ's endpoints used here. The
Presentation API and Image API are documented as freely accessible (the
Image API subject to an undisclosed daily request cap - see above); the
search endpoint is NOT documented as a public API at all (it is MDZ's own
web UI's backend, confirmed live only by inspecting that UI's client-side
code during development), so this pipeline treats it with EXTRA caution:
set MDZ_CONTACT_EMAIL (see below) so the User-Agent identifies this
research use on every request including search, keep --sleep conservative,
and coordinate any large-scale harvest with mdz@bsb-muenchen.de before
running it - the same courtesy the Bodleian/Gallica pipelines' docs ask
for. Reuse of MDZ images is governed by the license/rights statement each
manifest carries (commonly a rightsstatements.org URL); each book record in
books.jsonl carries that statement so it travels with the data.

Environment
-----------
Credentials are read from environment variables (never hardcode them in
this file, since it goes to GitHub). Put them in a local `.env` (gitignored)
or set them as RunPod pod environment variables / secrets.

    MDZ_CONTACT_EMAIL="you@example.org"   # optional but good practice

Either:
    AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING="...."
Or a container SAS URL, either as one variable:
    AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER_SAS_URL="https://<account>.blob.core.windows.net/<container>?<sas>"
or split into base + token (matches this project's existing frontend .env
naming, so the same .env can be reused as-is):
    VITE_AZURE_BLOB_BASE="https://<account>.blob.core.windows.net/<container>"
    VITE_AZURE_SAS_TOKEN="sp=...&sig=..."

The SAS token MUST include write permission (sp= must contain "w", typically
"c" too, e.g. sp=racwd) since this pipeline uploads pages. A read-only token
(sp=r) will be rejected at startup with a clear error before any GPU work
happens.

Install (RunPod / GPU machine)
-------------------------------
pip install -r requirements.txt
# torch/torchvision should already be present in most RunPod CUDA images;
# otherwise install a CUDA build matching your driver from
# https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ (see this project's notes on
# picking a CUDA build that matches `nvidia-smi`'s reported CUDA Version).

Running all five illustration pipelines at once
----------------------------------------------------
This script and the other four illustration pipelines write to fully
separate local directories and Azure prefixes (see "IMPORTANT" above), so
it's safe to run all five concurrently in their own tmux sessions on the
same pod:

    tmux new -s bodleian_illustration
    conda activate botany_yolo   # or whatever env has torch/ultralytics
    python bodleian_illustration_yolo_pipeline.py
    # detach: Ctrl-b d

    tmux new -s gallica_illustration
    conda activate botany_yolo
    python gallica_illustration_yolo_pipeline.py
    # detach: Ctrl-b d

    tmux new -s mdz_illustration
    conda activate botany_yolo
    python mdz_illustration_yolo_pipeline.py
    # detach: Ctrl-b d

    tmux new -s wellcome_illustration
    conda activate botany_yolo
    python wellcome_illustration_yolo_pipeline.py
    # detach: Ctrl-b d

    tmux new -s ndl_illustration
    conda activate botany_yolo
    python ndl_illustration_yolo_pipeline.py
    # detach: Ctrl-b d

    tmux attach -t bodleian_illustration   # reattach to check on any of them
    tmux attach -t gallica_illustration
    tmux attach -t mdz_illustration
    tmux attach -t wellcome_illustration
    tmux attach -t ndl_illustration
    tmux ls                                 # list all sessions

All five scripts default --device to the same auto-detected cuda:0, so on a
single-GPU pod they will share that one GPU's compute/VRAM - fine for a pod
like an RTX A4000 (16GB) running five small YOLO models concurrently
(they'll interleave GPU time rather than truly run in parallel), but if you
have a multi-GPU pod, pass --device cuda:1/cuda:2/cuda:3/cuda:4 to spread
them out.

    Resume every book currently paused ("in_progress") after a page-level

    exhausted its own backoff and still failed - the fix is elapsed
    wall-clock time (transient MDZ server issues, or a rate-limit cooldown,
    tend to clear up), not another immediate retry. Calling this between
    keyword searches (and once more at the end of the run) gives every
    paused book that gap naturally, instead of leaving it stuck until the
    same item happens to resurface under a later keyword's search results.

    A resumed book's manifest URL is reconstructed from its item id rather
    than replayed from the original search result (which isn't kept in
    state), since MDZ's manifest URL is a deterministic function of the
    item id. iiifAvailable can't be re-checked without another search
    result, but a book only reaches "in_progress" after already having
    successfully fetched its manifest once, so this is safe.
